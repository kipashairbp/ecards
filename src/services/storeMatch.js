// Match of a transaction's raw store name text (as reported by
// disccardpromos — services/cardSync.js's `vendor`) to a known participating
// store, so spend can be aggregated per store live. Falls back to null —
// the transaction still shows up in the ledger by name, just isn't linked
// to a store record yet.
//
// An explicit link (routes/stores.js's provider-links endpoints, set from a
// store's own profile) always wins when one exists — that's the whole point
// of letting an admin link "Amazon.com" the disccardpromos vendor name to
// "Amazon" the store record here even though the names don't match at all.
// Only when NO explicit link exists for this exact vendor name does this
// fall back to the old best-effort name matching, so an org that hasn't
// linked anything yet keeps behaving as before.
//
// PERFORMANCE: a sweep resolves this for every charge it sees (tens of
// thousands), almost always the same few hundred vendor names. The statements
// are prepared once and each answer is remembered for 30 seconds (and dropped
// at once by clearStoreMatchCache(), called whenever a link or store changes),
// instead of three fresh prepare()+query round trips per charge.
