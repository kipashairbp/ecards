// constraints against contracts/notes a prior undo just restored) — used

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Shared audit trail + generic undo/redo. Previously logAudit() was a local,
// unexported function duplicated only in shuls.js — every other route's
// mutations went completely unlogged. Pulled out here so every route can log
// consistently, and so undo/redo has one real implementation instead of N
// bespoke ones.
//
// Undo/redo works by restoring exactly the columns captured in before_json/
// after_json — NOT a full-row replace — so an undo never clobbers a column
// some *other*, later action touched. "Redo" isn't a separate code path:
// undoing an action logs a new audit_log row recording what it just did
// (before = the state right before the undo, after = the state it restored
// to); redoing is just calling undo() again on THAT new row. This keeps the
// history a simple forward-only append log instead of a branching structure.
//
// Only a curated set of action names are undoable at all (see
// UNDOABLE_ACTIONS below) — workflow/notification actions like esign, login,
// or send_contract have before/after shapes that don't represent full row
// state, and generically "restoring" them would do something destructive or
// meaningless (e.g. undoing an esign by deleting the contract row instead of
// un-signing it, which is a real, separate feature already).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// (see undoAuditEntry below), and that entry must itself be undoable — that
// symmetry IS how redo works, rather than a separate redo code path.
