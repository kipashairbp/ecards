// Locks an applicant's disccardpromos customer — used when an applicant is

// pending should trigger a lock on the card by disccard"), so their card(s)
// can't keep being spent once they're no longer approved. Per disccardpromos'
// real Customer API, `is_active` is a field on the CUSTOMER, not on an
// individual card — there is no per-card lock/deactivate endpoint at all —
// so this deactivates the whole customer record rather than any specific
// card, and every local card row for them is marked deactivated to match
// (an applicant only ever has one disccardpromos customer regardless of how
// many cards they hold). Reactivation on (re-)approval is folded directly
// into giftcard.js's upsertAccountForApproval (isActive: true alongside
// every other field in the same call) rather than a separate PATCH here —
// live-tested 2026-08-19 that a bare `{is_active: true}` PATCH issued right
// after account creation/update was wiping the external_id that same
// approval had just set, breaking duplicate-customer prevention and
// add-funds (both look the customer up by external_id) on every approval.
// Best-effort: a provider failure is returned to the caller to surface, but
// never blocks the status change that triggered it — the local rows are
// still marked deactivated either way, since "no longer approved" should
// never show as still-active in our own UI regardless of whether the
