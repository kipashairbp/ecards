// every admin page load (see renderShell() in app.js), so this stays a
// separate, minimal query rather than reusing the much heavier /stats
// (which joins across cards/stores/duplicate flags too). Respects each
// resource's view permission the same way /stats does, so a role that
// can't see a resource never gets a dot for it.
//
// Shuls and applicants are scoped to the org's current active season (#10:
// "make sure the red dots only work when needed") — without this, a shul or
// applicant left sitting unactioned in a long-closed past season would keep
// lighting up the nav forever, since nothing else ever revisits old-season
// records once a new season starts. Stores aren't season-scoped here since
// a store is one persistent record reused every season (see
// routes/stores.js's /:id/season-history), not a fresh per-season row —
// setup_status='pending' is meaningful regardless of season.
